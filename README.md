location_county

This Drupal module provides a county field for the Location module. To use, put
the location_county folder in Drupal's modules directory (i.e. sites/all/modules)
and enable the module.

Depends on Location module (https://www.drupal.org/project/location).

Original issue can be tracked at https://www.drupal.org/node/221370 . A patch
for the Location module is also available there, which adds this module to the
contrib folder of Location.
